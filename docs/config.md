# config

Sockets comes with a configuration file that will be published when you run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=sockets` (see [quickstart](../README.md) or [setup command](artisan.md#setup-command)). The configuration allows you to set [black- and whitelisting](listing.md), set the port and the host to listen on in a fluent and easy way. This document is very small given the extensive amount of documentation contained in the config file itself. You can read the full documentation for the options available [here](https://github.com/Experus/sockets/blob/dev/files/config.php).
